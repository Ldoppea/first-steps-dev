# What's this site?

The world of software development is large. There are plenty of concepts to discover, tools to learn and methodologies to master and it can be difficult to know how to get started.

This is a list of free resources that you may find helpful in learning about various concepts, tools and methodologies related to software development.

Every link has its place in this list if it can help a developer discover the topic in question.

**Tags**

Each link is suffixed with one of the following 4 tags in order to give more information about its content:

- `What`: the link presents the concept, tool or methodology and explains its foundations
- `Why`: the link explains in which cases a developer may need to use this concept, tool or methodology
- `How`: the link explains the basics necessary to set up this concept, this tool or this methodology
- `Resources`: the link groups together resources to learn about this concept, tool or methodology

Of course a link can cover several tags at the same time, in that case each tag is added in the order from the most represented to the least represented.
