# Contribuer au projet

You can contribute to this project by creating a [Pull Request](https://github.com/Ldoppea/first-steps-dev/pulls). Contributors must abide to this project [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

For example, you can propose a new link, new category, delete a linked that became invalid, fix typos or tags, or propose new ideas.

Be sure to have a look to this checklist before submitting a new PR:

- [ ] The proposed link should target content preferably in the same language as the list it's added to. You can however propose English content to non-english lists if it's high quality and add the `[ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸]` suffix after the link.
- [ ] The linked content is free and non-gated (i.e. it should not require a subscription to access it).
- [ ] The linked content does not contain any offensive material of any sort that would result in a breach of the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
